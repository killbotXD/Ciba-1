#### An app that prebooks food orders and prevents waiting time.

This app has two types of users: customer and merchant.

A customer can select food items from the menu and put them into the cart and then order them. Then the merchant is notified about the order and if he can accept or reject the order. If the order is accepted then he provides a time period in which the customer can except his order to get prepared.

The merchant can enable or disable the room/home delivery option.

Also a customer can choose to pay using paytm, google pay, cod.

There will be a cancellation time after which a user cannot cancel the order.
